# Front-end-notOfferUp
This a full-stack MERN app based on the popular online marketplace OfferUp. It was completed by a group of new-ish software engineers and part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive coursework. 

## Summary 
For this project, we decided to build an OfferUp app. We liked this project because it seemed like an approachable challenge for our first ever full-stack application. We completed this over the course of two weeks. While we met our initial goals of building a simple app, we also attempted to build out some of our stretch goals with varying success and ran into some really difficult roadblocks. For the sake of this ReadMe, I'll focus on the Front-End experience. 

## Features
One of our most successful features is our `AddListing` feature which allows users to RESTfully create resources that are logged in the backend database. This was one of the more challenging aspects but we figured it out after reading a lot about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). The databases were challenging to work with mainly for this reason. We learned a bit about adjusting CORS headers and the mechanism of transfering data from server to browser. 

### CORB Bugs
One of the biggest front-end issues we're stil working with is the trouble of getting images to reliably populate. We're working through a Cross-Origin Read Blocking error that prevents our browser from rendering URL links in our database. 

### Next steps
Going forward, there are several things we could continue to work on. Top of the list would be to solve this CORB bug. It's annoying and prevents us from really getting to a point where we feel satisified. 
We would also like to better understand how to build out the categories page. This is currently not working as we would like. 
Finally, Craigslist and OfferUp both have native search features. We could add a search feature that would make it easier to locate single products.
