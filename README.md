# Front-end-notOfferUp
This a full-stack MERN app based on the popular online marketplace OfferUp. It was completed by a group of new-ish software engineers and part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive coursework. 

##Summary 
For this project, we decided to build an OfferUp app. We liked this project because it seemed like an approachable challenge for our first ever full-stack application. We completed this over the course of two weeks. While we met our initial goals of building a simple app, we also attempted to build out some of our stretch goals with varying success and ran into some really difficult roadblocks. For the sake of this ReadMe, I'll focus on the Front-End experience.
